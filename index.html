     <h2 align="middle"><strong><em>A little about me</em></strong></h2>
    <p align="middle">
    Hello my name is Landon Harness and I take computer science at Plymouth High school. I
    <br>
    am from Indiana and have lived here my whole life. I take place in Vex Robotics and honestly
    <br>
    if I would put in some work, I could do better than the Plymouth middle school team.
    </p>
    <h2 align="middle"><strong><em>My Spirit Animal</em></strong></h2>
    <p align="middle">
    The cow is my spirit animal. Cows are lazy, have great memory, and they form great friendships.
    <br>
    Cows also have an amazing nose that can smell odors up to 6 miles away! Since cows are a big
    <br>
    animal, they can consume up to 40 pounds of food a day. Plus, I think cows are cool because
    <br>
    in 1850 almost every family owned a cow.
