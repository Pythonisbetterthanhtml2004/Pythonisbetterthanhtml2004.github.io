					<h2> Stuff about the Beach </h2>
					<p>
					<strong>Fort Myers</strong> is named one of the best beaches in the United states for shelling! Thomas Edison spent many years at/by <strong>Fort Myers beach</strong>. He is considered to be one of the most inventive man who ever lived, holding 1,093 patents. For 15 miles along McGregor Boulevard, lined on both sides with statuesque royal palm trees, were one of the first imported from Cuba, and planted by Thomas Edison. <strong>Fort Myers</strong> main beach, <strong>Fort Myers</strong> beach, is really great for fishing. If you don't have a fishing license, you won't need to buy one if you fish on the pier. The pier is free entry, allowing you to bring you fishing pole and a tackle box, allowing you not to worry about anything.

						<h2 align="middle"> Stuff to do other than going to the beach</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>Fort Myers</strong> has more to do than go to the beach. There are multiple walking trails, parks, malls, and attractions.
							The best park to go to while in <strong>Fort Myers</strong> is the John Yarbrough Linear Park. John Yarbrough Linear Park is full of
						wildlife trees and many walking trails. The best mall while you are in <strong>Fort Myer</strong> is the Miromar Mall. There is multiple
						stores there including Nike, Underarmor, Adidas, Crocs, Gap, Old Navy, and many more. The main attraction I have been to in
						<strong>Fort Myers</strong> is Sun Harvest Citrus. Sun Harvest Citrus gives out free samples of Orange Juice, Oranges, and many other fruits.
						Sun Harvest Citrus also, has a mighty good orange icecream.
