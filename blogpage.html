          Hello world! Today I created this blog, even though there is one post
          before this. Overall, creating a blog page isn't that hard. I thought
          I would put the post inside a bubble to make it more visually appealing.
          Also, I met every requirement by putting two posts on the page, editing
          some css, creating a table of contents, and internally linking the parts of
          the table of contents. Updates for the blog will come weekly, and maybe
          this page layout will change over time.

          <p class="post">Hello World! Today I finshed my AP expore task. I took me so long to
            finish it because I am a big procrastinator. With that, I just started
            the explore task the monday before this post. Overall, I would not recommend
            doing that because it is very stressful and creating it takes a long
            portion of your time. Also, I would not recommend doing that because
            you also also might not do good on it. </p>
